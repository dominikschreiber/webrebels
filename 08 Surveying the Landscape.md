# Surveying the Landscape

- danger: the web gets marginalized
- threats to the prosperity of the web:
	- commoditisation (work gets automated)
	- apps (better ux, more focus)
		- app-only strategy (e.g. Apple, Snapchat)
		- iOS + android have ways to open apps instead of web links
	- advertising/tracking (has chilling effects on users)
	- monetisation (adblockers caused revenue drop of 22bn $ in 2014)
		- few centralized websites instead of diverse website landscape
	- platforms (< 2002: portals; < 2013: search engines; >= 2013: platforms)
	- the next billion (4bn people online 2018)
		- mobile by default
		- surfing is expensive (https://whatdoesmysitecost.com, e.g. 1GB prepaid data ~ 15% avg month income in Myanmar)
		- *Facebook is the internet*: Instant articles (on Facebook) provide 10&times; the performance of shared stories
	- messaging platforms
		- platforms host content on their own (because of *performance*)
		- bots provide dynamic services
	- headless (e.g. wearables)
	- voice / no UI (e.g. Amazon Echo, Google Home)
- it's not all bad
	- web-first promises fast growth (see slack etc.)
	- with electron, web technologies can be used on desktop
	- *progressive web apps* are best practices for matching expectations users have
	- *physical web* => beacon sending url, physical notifications
	- *web bluetooth* => web app pairs with bluetooth devices
	- *nfc api*
	- *geolocation api*
	- *payments api*
