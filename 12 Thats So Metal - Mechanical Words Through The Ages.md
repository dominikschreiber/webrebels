- visceral programming: understand concepts by mapping them to real things
	- map/reduce is like knitting
	- quicksort is like knitting
	- computers are like knitting machines controlled by punchcards
	- web worker is like the international space station
- typesetting history
	- *linotype* typesetting machine: keypress adds type to line, after writing type is sorted back (invented 1886, used until 1978)
	- *coldtype*: type burnt into paper, then cut by graphics designers, then photocopied
	- industrial type setting system: font family + size + weight
	- linux type setting system (Bell Lab): document preparation system, *troff* programming language for typesetting
		- preprocessors (`tbl` for tables, `eqn` for equations)
		- code set in helvetica (not monospaced) &ndash; b/c AT&T did not have a monospace font (2nd edition had -> code set in Courier)
	- *linotron 202* cathode ray tube: typesetting free of font (can draw arbitrary vector graphics)
		-  linotron 202 reverse engineered by Bell Lab (original software was crap)
	- laser printers (Xerox PARC): bitmap instead of vector graphics
		- font hinting (PostScript, Adobe): metadata for font -> bitmap
		- PostScript -> PDF (code inlined for performance: 2m44s to 22s)
	- world wide web
		- CSS to allow graphics designers to express what they are doing on paper
		- 1999: Emojis in Japan, b/c image on mobile only as gif (with multiple requests => slow)
		- JIS X 4051: standard for japanese type setting => CSS writing modes, CSS text decoration
