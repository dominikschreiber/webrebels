# Unleash the Distributed Web
David Dias ([@daviddias](https://twitter.com/@daviddias))

- dependency on the web causes problems
- web moved from distributed to centralized due to politic decisions and convenience
- resource discovery problem
	- web is fragile due to location addressing (domain => resolve to ip address => contact ip address)
	- multiple unicasts are expensive (100 clients accessing the same 1 resource cause 100 sends)
	- problems with the web:
		- disconnected
		- bandwidth
		- offline
		- performance
		- security
		- IoT
		- control
- IPFS (the interplanetary filesystem)
	- protocol to **upgrade the web**, basically a big merkle tree
	- features:
		- links do not break
		- verify what you recieve
		- works offline
	- reference element by cryptographic hash (=> MERKLE LINK, see [Merkle Tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merkle_tree))
	- IPLD: InterPlanetary Linked Data => links are hashes
		- http://example.com/hugo resolved to http://10.11.12.13/hugo
		- /ipns/example.com/hugo resolved to /ipfs/QmW98oJrc5FT6/hugo
	- distributed resource discovery
		- p2p routing overlay over IP network => not bound to ip addressing scheme
		- announce file possession to close nodes (e.g. `hash(f) == 91`, announce to `91&plusmin;5`)
		- find files by looking in nodes close to hash
		- [libp2p](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merkle_tree) is the network stack of IPFS
- distributed web applications
	- use cases
		- content distribution
		- sensitive data (b/c data is verified)
		- huge data sizes
		- webapp w/ components from different endpoints
