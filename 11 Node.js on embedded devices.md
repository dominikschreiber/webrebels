# The Eternal Struggle: Node.js on embedded devices
Jon McKay ([@jonmckay](https://@jonmckay))

- why node.js for embedded devices?
	- open-source, community-contributed code
	- package manager
	- emphasis on building better tools
	- more flexible language
- how to build an embedded system w/ node.js:
	- either a chinese SOC
	- or a microcontroller w/ english docs
	- constraints: no operating system, 32mb ram/flash, 180mhz => lua (w/ luajit -- nearly as fast as c)
	- tessel: compiles js to lua and runs lua on arduino (has parts of node/js re-written in lua)
	- tessel hardware modules have npm package names for instant use
- major pitfalls of the tessel 1 architecture
	- node/js re-written in lua => need to keep up with node updates
	- proprietary wifi-chip often failing => have to wait for firmware updates due to closed-source
	- too much power consumption for long-life, not the features of a high power-consumption product
	- too much over-simplification
- tessel 2 (-> https://tessel.io)
	- high power (b/c has wifi)
	- runs Linux
	- runs regular Node.js
	- uses wifi SOC
- potential tessel 2 pitfalls
	- wifi built-in to all popular boards
	- entirely volunteer-driven => fewer resources
	- RAM might not be sufficient for expectations of Linux
	- binary modules not as simple as expected
- why will more embedded devices use Node.js?
	- high-power chips are not necessarily more expensive than low-power devices (due to large numbers built into smartphones) => only question: has this to run on battery?
